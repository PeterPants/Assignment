DESIGN DETAILS SPECIFIC TO CODE:
	Code is in C++
	Libraries used include to following: 
		#include <iostream>
		#include <sstream>
		#include <map>
		#include <stdlib.h>
		#include <fstream>
		#include <vector>
		#include <string>
		#include <algorithm>
		#include <gdbm.h>

Different folders:
	lab 2a
	lab 2b
	lab 3


HOW TO BUILD/RUN PROGRAM:
	Open Terminal and type : git clone ssh://group15@softeng.cs.wits.ac.za/ugd/group15/Desktop/group15
	You will be prompted for a password: pholeegh

	The above will put a folder "group15" with all our work to markers home directory

In the group15 folder should be a zipped folder "COMS3002.zip" 	
Unziping the "COMS3002.zip" folder should be three folders: lab 2a, lab 2b, lab 3

 
	Bulding and running is done separately by doing the below thrice (once in lab2a folder, once in lab2b folder, and again in lab3 folder)
	Building the program is done using the terminal since there is no UI for the following code.
	
	To build the code make sure you are in the correct directory i.e. either lab 2a or lab2b or lab 3 depending on the code you wish to run
	  e.g. if the Document folder(lab2a) is saved onto the Desktop then on your terminal command line type - cd Desktop/lab2a 

	Once you are in the correct directory,
	there will be three different directories for the different programs
	type - cd *folder_name*(folder u wish to enter) - into the command line
	Type - make - into the terminal command line. This will build the program code.
	The executable file will be named hello
	To run the program type - ./hello - into the command line.
	%This process works for all three folders%
	The program will then execute and you may enjoy the use of this program.
